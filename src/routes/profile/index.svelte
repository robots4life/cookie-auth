	// Stores are contextual â€” they are added to the context of your root component.
	// This means that session and page are unique to each request on the server,
	// rather than shared between multiple requests handled by the same server simultaneously,
	// which is what makes it safe to include user-specific data in session.
	//
	// session from hooks.js is stored in $app/stores and available on every endpoint
	import { session } from '$app/stores';
